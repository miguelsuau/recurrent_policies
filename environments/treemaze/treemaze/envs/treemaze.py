class TreeMazeEnv(gym.Env):
    """ T-maze with several branches

        This is discrete environment that looks like a tree :

                      ---- 4
                ---- 2
               |      ---- 5
        I ---- 1
               |      ---- 6
                ---- 3
                      ---- 7

        The maze consists of corridors of length S. After each
        corridor is a branch where the agent can go up or down. After going up
        or down, the agent must go right for S steps before reaching the next
        branching point. The tree has a height H. At each episode, a leaf L is
        choosen randomly as a goal state. Reaching the goal gives a reward of 10.
        Each move goves a reward of -0.1.

        The agent is able to observe its position in the current corridor (distance
        between the agent and the next branch), along with an additional binary
        observation, o. During the first H time-steps, o = whether to go up at the
        i-th branch.

        The goal of the environment is to have the agent learn to remember information
        during the first H time-steps, then use it to navigate the maze.
